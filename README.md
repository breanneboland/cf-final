Lo and Behold!
==============
Breanne Boland's Foundations I Final
------------------------------------
Things to know:
* My sorting mechanism came from here: http://jsfiddle.net/stefek99/y7JyT/
* I could not get the visualization bit to work. Next time, next time.
* Nick Klunder was both quite helpful and quite patient. Thank you.

That is all. See you in Foundations II.
